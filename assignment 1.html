   <h1 style="color:blue;background-color:white;text-align:center"> INDIA </h1>
   <p style="color:red;background-color:yellow">India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. 
   It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.
   [62] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. 
   From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.
   [64] India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[
   65] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.
   [66] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure.
   It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.</P>
